<h2 align="center">🌟 Profile 🌟</h2>

<p align="justify">
Hello! I'm Pinkrah Nana Ofosuhene, a Teaching and Research Assistant in the Department of Meteorology and Climate Science at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. My passion lies in understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change, with a special interest in meteorology in the tropics, climate dynamics, and boundary layer meteorology.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My research delves into heatwave trends across regions like Bole, Navrongo, Wa, Walewale, and Yendi, particularly under different climate scenarios such as RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6. Through my work, I aim to uncover how future climate conditions will influence the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and support resilience-building efforts within communities.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In addition to climate research, I've explored an SEIR model for HIV/AIDS in Ghana. I focus on ensuring that my models reflect real-world dynamics with accurate constraints, striving for impactful, research-backed decisions.
</p>

<p align="justify">
👨‍🏫 As a facilitator at Gumption Ex, I take pride in mentoring students, teaching programming languages such as Python for data analysis, weather forecasting, and climate simulations. I’m also proficient in C++, which I use for programming traffic lights and simulating vehicle movements using Arduino. Sharing knowledge and simplifying complex concepts is something I thoroughly enjoy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Beyond academia, I run training programs for young learners in programming and manage a YouTube channel dedicated to Python tutorials and CDO insights. Education and mentorship are core to who I am as a professional and as a person.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Whether it’s research, programming, or mentorship, I aim to make a meaningful impact in climate science, epidemiology, and education. I’m driven by the desire to use my skills to foster resilience, advocate for impactful policy decisions, and empower others through hands-on learning.
