<h2 align="center">🌟 Profile 🌟</h2>

<p align="justify">
Hello! I'm Pinkrah Nana Ofosuhene, a Teaching and Research Assistant in the Department of Meteorology and Climate Science at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. My passion lies in understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change, with a special interest in Climate modelling, Weather Research and Forecast, meteorology in the tropics, climate dynamics, and boundary layer meteorology.

My current research delves into heatwave trends across Ghana. Heatwaves pose escalating threats to public health, agriculture, and societal systems due to climate change. Despite global evidence of heatwaves occurrence including West Africa, there is a notable lack of information on the prevalence and characteristics of heatwaves in Ghana. To address this gap, we analyzed the historical occurrence, frequency, duration, and intensity of daytime heatwaves across the five agro-ecological zones in Ghana. The choice of Ghana is informed by its high temperatures, variable rainfall, and fluctuating relative humidity. We utilized daily maximum temperature data obtained from the Ghana Meteorological Agency, covering the period from 1961 to 2020. Heatwaves were defined as periods of three or more consecutive days where daily maximum temperatures exceed the 95th percentile of historical temperature records for the respective location. Our analysis revealed that heatwaves historically occurred in Ghana primarily from January to April, with an annual frequency of 0 to 8 events, maximum durations up to 37 days, and magnitudes ranging from 0°C to 4°C. The results highlight significant spatial and seasonal variability, with the Coastal Preprint submitted to Environmental Research January 21, 2025 and Forest zones experiencing comparatively lower heatwave intensities with a threshold of 33.80°C and 34.80°C respectively due to moderating factors such as vegetation cover, higher humidity, and proximity to the ocean as compared to the Sudan, Guinea Savannah and Transitional areas of Ghana with a threshold of 40.60°C, 39.40°C and 36.05°C respectively. Nevertheless, all climatic zones have exhibited a notable rise in heatwave magnitude and frequency over the study period. These trends underscore the intensifying influence of global warming and its pervasive impacts across diverse climatic regions in Ghana. These findings highlight a significant increase in heatwave events, duration and intensity in Ghana, with severe implications for ecosystems and human health. This underscores the urgent need for enhanced planning, early warning systems, and adaptive strategies to mitigate the impacts on vulnerable populations.
