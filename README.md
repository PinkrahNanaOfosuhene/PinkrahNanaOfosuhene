<h2 align="center">🌟 Profile 🌟</h2>

<p align="justify">
Hello! I am Pinkrah Nana Ofosuhene, a current Teaching and Research Assistant in the Department of Meteorology and Climate Science at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. My passion lies in understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change, with a special interest in Climate modelling, Weather Research and Forecast, meteorology in the tropics, and climate dynamics.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My current research delves into heatwave trends across Ghana. Heatwaves, driven by climate change, pose growing risks to public health, agriculture, and society. In Ghana, they are often overlooked, with high temperatures perceived as isolated events rather than heatwaves. As a result, research on their historical prevalence, intensity, and frequency is scarce. To bridge this gap and support early warning systems and risk management, we analyzed the historical occurrence, frequency, duration, and intensity of
heatwaves across Ghana’s climatic zones. We analyzed daily maximum temperature data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency spanning 1961 to 2020. Heatwaves were defined using a temperature-based percentile approach, identifying periods of three or more consecutive days where daily maximum temperatures exceeded the 97.5th percentile of historical records for each zone. Our results indicated that heatwaves in Ghana have become more frequent, longer duration, and more intense from 1961 to 2020, with the most significant increases occurring from 1980 onward. Their intensity decreased latitudinally from north to south across all climatic zones. The Sudan Savannah experienced the most extreme heatwaves mostly in March–April, reaching 2.5°C above the 97.5th percentile threshold of 41.2°C. The Guinea Savannah followed, with episodes mostly in February–March with magnitudes up to 2.0°C above the threshold of 40.0°C. In the Forest zone, heatwaves were predominant in February–March, with magnitudes between 1.0–2.0°C above the threshold of 35.5 degree celcius. The Coastal areas recorded fewer episodes compared to other zones widely occurring in February–April with similar intensity of 1.0–2.0°C above 34.1°C threshold. The temperature anomalies showed a sustained warming trend from the 1980s onward, with all zones surpassing 2.0°C warming by 2020. This period aligned with the sharp rise in heatwave events in all zones, emphasizing their serious impacts on ecosystems and public health. Urgent action is needed to enhance early warning systems, climate adaptation, and mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable populations in Ghana (submitted to Environmental Research, 2025)
